Perfect! Let’s create a complete Stage 5 AI Agent — this includes:

Memory (Stage 2) ✅

Web Search (Stage 3) ✅

Document Reading (Stage 4) ✅

Persistent RAG / Long-Term Knowledge Base ✅

This agent will store embeddings to disk using FAISS so it can answer document-related queries intelligently across restarts.

✅ How to Use Stage 5

Ensure docs/ folder exists and contains .txt, .pdf, or .docx files.

Install dependencies:

pip install ollama rich duckduckgo-search requests beautifulsoup4 readability-lxml lxml docx PyPDF2 sentence-transformers faiss-cpu numpy


Run:

python agent.py


Commands:

Command	Description
search: <query>	Web search using DuckDuckGo
rag: <query>	Search your local documents intelligently (Persistent RAG)
Normal text	Chat with Ollama model

The FAISS index is saved as faiss_index.index.

Texts are saved as doc_texts.json.

On next run, it doesn’t rebuild embeddings unless you delete these files.

Now you can type:
rag: Explain digital money transfer


and the agent will use your docs intelligently, remembering them across restarts.
