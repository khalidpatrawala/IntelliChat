Great âœ… Letâ€™s upgrade your agent.py to Stage 2 (short-term memory).
This way, the agent will remember the whole conversation history while you chat.

ðŸ”¹ Changes weâ€™ll make:

Maintain a global history list.

Pass history into ollama.chat() each time.

Store both user and assistant messages in memory.

(Optional) Save history to a history.json file so it doesnâ€™t reset when you restart.
ðŸ”¹ How to Use

Save this file as agent.py.

Run:

python agent.py


Chat with it normally. Example:

You: Hi, who are you?
Assistant: I'm your AI Agent running locally with Ollama.
You: What did I just ask you?
Assistant: You asked me "Hi, who are you?"


ðŸ‘‰ Now it remembers your past conversation, even if you restart the script! ðŸŽ‰
