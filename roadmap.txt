🛠 Roadmap: From Basic Agent → Pro AI Agent
✅ Stage 1 — Starter Agent (you already did this)

Chat with Ollama model (llama3.1:8b)

Reads from your docs/ folder using embeddings + FAISS

Clean answers printed in terminal

👉 Status: Working now

📌 Stage 2 — Add Memory

Right now, the agent forgets your past questions. Let’s add short-term memory (conversation history).

🔹 What to do:

Save all past Q&A into a list (history).

Pass the history back into ollama.chat().

(Optional) Store in a JSON file so memory persists even after restart.

📌 Stage 3 — Web Search Tool

Let the agent pull fresh info from the internet if your local docs don’t cover it.

🔹 Libraries to install:

pip install duckduckgo-search requests beautifulsoup4 readability-lxml


🔹 Idea:

Use duckduckgo_search to get top results.

Fetch the page → extract clean text with readability-lxml.

Send that as context to Ollama.

📌 Stage 4 — Better Document Support

Support PDFs, Word files, CSVs instead of only .txt

Use libraries:

pypdf (for PDFs)

python-docx (for Word)

pandas (for CSV/Excel)

Store everything in FAISS for fast retrieval.

📌 Stage 5 — Long-Term Knowledge Base

Instead of only re-building FAISS each time, save embeddings to disk (using faiss.write_index).

This way, your AI agent can “remember” docs permanently, even across restarts.

📌 Stage 6 — Add Tools

Make your agent more like ChatGPT Plugins:

Calculator → eval() math safely

Code execution → run Python snippets

File writer → save summaries or notes into notes/ folder

Reminders/To-Dos

📌 Stage 7 — Web App (Streamlit/Gradio)

Turn your CLI agent into a web app:

pip install streamlit

Build a chat UI (text box + history panel)

Users can upload files to add into RAG automatically

📌 Stage 8 — Pro Agent (Multi-Tool + Orchestrator)

By now, you’ll have:

Chat + Memory + Web Search + RAG (docs) + Tools

Add a decision layer:

If user asks “math” → use calculator

If “search” → use DuckDuckGo

If “doc Q&A” → use FAISS

Else → fallback to Ollama

This is the foundation of a personal AI assistant.

⚡️ Suggested Learning Path (for a beginner)

Run the starter agent until you’re comfortable.

Add memory (Stage 2).

Add web search (Stage 3).

Upgrade docs to PDFs/Word (Stage 4).

Wrap into a Streamlit app (Stage 7).

Each step is small but builds toward a powerful AI system.
